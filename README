Program was created to play around with gnu plot and I was curious to
how the project 1999 server's population changed. The idea was partly
so that I could log on during 'prime time'. I also wanted to watch 
the population change based on other factors, like the release of Diablo 3,
or when say a raid target popped. 
 
At the current moment (May 07, 2012) I haven't really played much due
to a update where some mobs were `hasted` and I haven't really had much
time to play. Still fun to watch the graph though.
